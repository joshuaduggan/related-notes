Database Description

relationships
The midpoint (relationship_id) and one end point of a link. Join two relationships together by sharing a relationship_id to create a complete two way link. Related Notes expects all relationships to be made up of precisely two entries linking to two different notes.

relationships.relationship_id; int
Each pair of relationships are identified by a common but otherwise unique relationship_id. The Related Notes app generates these by using the id of the first relationships pair to be created.


Database SQL Commands

// Delete all relationships containing the specified note. Note that we need to
// create a temp table to delete while selecting from the same table
DELETE FROM relationships WHERE relationship_id IN (
  SELECT relationship_id FROM (
    SELECT * from relationships WHERE note_id = $noteId
  ) AS temp
)

// Get id's of notes that share relationships with this note.
SELECT note_id FROM relationships WHERE relationship_id IN (
  SELECT relationship_id FROM relationships WHERE note_id = $noteId
) AND note_id <> $noteId
